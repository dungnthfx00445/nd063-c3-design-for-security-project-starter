Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

# Identified Vulnerabilities

1. Insecure HTTP Communication
   - Vulnerability: The web application is using HTTP (port 80) instead of HTTPS
   - Related to Project: Yes - the load balancer is configured to listen on port 80
   - Impact: Potential interception of sensitive data in transit
   Remediation:
   - Configure HTTPS on the load balancer using an SSL/TLS certificate
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
   - Update application code to use HTTPS endpoints

2. Public EC2 Instance Exposure
   - Vulnerability: Web application instance has direct public IP access
   - Related to Project: Yes - current architecture exposes the EC2 instance
   - Impact: Increased attack surface for direct exploitation attempts
   Remediation:
   - Move the EC2 instance to a private subnet
   - Route all traffic through the load balancer
   - Use Security Groups to restrict access to only the load balancer

3. IAM Security Configuration
   - Vulnerability: Potential excessive permissions in IAM roles
   - Related to Project: Yes - involves S3 bucket access permissions
   - Impact: Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data
   Remediation:
   - Implement least privilege access for IAM roles
   - Regularly audit and review IAM permissions
   - Use specific bucket policies for S3 access

4. Network Security Groups
   - Vulnerability: Overly permissive security group rules
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects application access control
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to resources
   Remediation:
   - Restrict security group rules to necessary ports only
   - Implement proper network segmentation
   - Regular audit of security group configurations

5. Logging and Monitoring
   - Vulnerability: Insufficient logging and monitoring
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects security visibility
   - Impact: Delayed detection of security incidents
   Remediation:
   - Enable CloudTrail logging for all regions
   - Configure CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activities
   - Implement centralized logging solution

Bonus Recommendations:

1. Infrastructure Security
   - Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) on the load balancer
   - Use AWS Shield for DDoS protection
   - Regular security patching and updates

2. Data Security
   - Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS
   - Implement bucket versioning for S3
   - Regular backup and recovery testing

3. Compliance and Governance
   - Regular security assessments
   - Implement automated compliance checking
   - Document and maintain security procedures

4. Application Security
   - Implement input validation
   - Use secure coding practices
   - Regular security testing and code reviews

# Identified Vulnerabilities from AWS Config Findings

1. Subnet Auto-Assignment Issue (securityhub-subnet-auto-assign...)
   - Vulnerability: 6 Non-compliant resources detected
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects VPC/network configuration
   - Impact: Potential network accessibility issues
   Remediation:
   - Review and configure subnet auto-assignment settings
   - Ensure proper network segmentation
   - Implement proper public/private subnet configuration

2. Root Account Management (securityhub-root-account-mf...)
   - Vulnerability: 1 Non-compliant resource
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects account security
   - Impact: Potential unauthorized root account access
   Remediation:
   - Implement MFA for root account
   - Follow AWS root account security best practices
   - Regularly audit root account usage

3. Lambda Function Configuration (securityhub-inspector-lambd...)
   - Vulnerability: Multiple non-compliant resources
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects serverless components
   - Impact: Potential security gaps in Lambda functions
   Remediation:
   - Review Lambda function permissions
   - Implement proper function role configurations
   - Enable Lambda function monitoring

4. VPC Endpoint Configuration (securityhub-vpc-endpoint-en...)
   - Vulnerability: 1 Non-compliant resource
   - Related to Project: Yes - affects network security
   - Impact: Potential exposure of VPC resources
   Remediation:
   - Configure VPC endpoints properly
   - Implement endpoint policies
   - Review and restrict endpoint access

Summary of Findings:
- Total Non-compliant rules: 33
- Compliant rules: 12
- Non-compliant resources: 10
- Compliant resources: 1

These findings indicate several security configuration issues that need to be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the deployment.
